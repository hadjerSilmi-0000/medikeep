**# MediKeep

> A full-stack healthcare management platform connecting doctors and patients through a clean, secure, and role-aware web application.

## What is MediKeep?

MediKeep is a medical dashboard built as a portfolio project simulating a real-world clinic management system. Doctors can manage their patient list, schedule appointments, issue prescriptions, and track analytics. Patients can book appointments with doctors, view their prescriptions, and monitor their health activity — all in real time.

The project is split into two independent applications that work together:

```
MediKeep/
├── frontend/     ← Next.js 14 web app
└── backend/      ← Node.js + Express REST API
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hadjerSilmi-0000/medikeep.git
cd medikeep
```

### 2. Set up the database

```bash
mysql -u root -p < backend/db/schema.sql
```

### 3. Configure the backend

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in DB credentials, JWT secrets, email config
npm install
npm run dev
```

Backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 4. Configure the frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
# Create .env.local
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api" >> .env.local
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000" >> .env.local

# Place your bone illustration background
cp /path/to/authbg.jpg public/authbg.jpg

npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Security Highlights

- **httpOnly cookies** — tokens never exposed to JavaScript
- **Token blacklist** — immediate invalidation on logout
- **Account lockout** — 5 failed attempts triggers a 30-minute lock
- **Email verification** — required before first login
- **Rate limiting** — per-route limits (login: 5/15min, register: 3/hour)
- **Helmet.js** — 11 HTTP security headers
- **Input sanitization** — XSS protection on all inputs
- **Parameterized queries** — no raw SQL concatenation anywhere
- **Role-based routing** — middleware blocks wrong-role access at the API level and in the UI

---

## Design

The UI uses a custom light green medical palette with no dark mode. Auth pages feature a full-page anatomical bone illustration background with a centered frosted card. The dashboard uses a persistent sidebar with role-specific navigation. All data tables support pagination, search, and filtering.
